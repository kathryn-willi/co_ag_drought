# Colorado River Basin Hydrologic Data Scripts

This repository contains R scripts for hydrologic data collection and watershed delineation in the Colorado River Basin. `for_eva.R` automates the retrieval of daily discharge data from USGS stream gages across the Colorado River Basin (HUCs 1401-1508) for a 30-year period (1985-2015 water years), filtering sites based on spatial location within basin boundaries and temporal data availability, then downloading and consolidating data into CSV files for each gage with quality-controlled discharge values. `getWatersheds.R` provides a custom function that delineates watershed boundaries for any area of interest by retrieving NHDPlus flowlines and catchments, identifying flowlines that cross the AOI boundary, tracing upstream contributing areas using NLDI basin queries, and handling edge cases like escaping flowlines or isolated segments to produce a clean, topologically valid watershed polygon that precisely matches the drainage area contributing to the AOI.
